# Introduction & Overview

In the first two units, we'll be going over some Matlab basics:
- how to start up the Matlab interpreter, + integrated development environment (IDE)
- some *syntax*, simple commands
- generally getting comfortable with the idea of turning your ideas into code


## Materials

You can refer to a short [matlab primer](c84nim-exercises.pdf) that will walk you through some of the basics.

## Exercises

To make sure you are ready for the mini-projects (1) on building a simple *behavioural* experiment (or 2) related to the neuroimaging analysis, I suggest you walk through the following sets of exercises on the Matlab command prompt. **It's important that you _think_ about what should be happening before you hit the return key to execute the code**. You could even put all the lines into a file in the Matlab editor window and write comments to go along:

1. [Doing basic maths on the command prompt](01-firstSteps.md)
2. [Simple commands](02-simpleCommands.md) for getting the mean, std, etc.
3. [More simple commands](03-moreSimpleCommands.md) and some practice making vectors and matrices that contain specific things.
4. [Scripts and functions](04-scriptsAndFunctions.md) - why they are useful, how they work.
5. [Plotting data](05-plottingData.md) - making simple plots.
6. [Loops, if/else, controlling flow](06-loopsAndControls.md) - making simple plots.  
7. [Test your knowledge](07-debugTheCode.md) - understand an existing piece of code and fix it up (debug + refactor)
8. [Application: loop over multiple plots](08-loopOverPlots.md) - plot a family of curves (with nice colors)
9. [Application: nested loops to construct filenames](09-nestedLoops.md) - make strings / text that follows a certain pattern.
