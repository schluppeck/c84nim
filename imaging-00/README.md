# imaging-00

In this unit we'll get to work with some imaging data (2d, 3d images) and see some of the matlab commands for interacting with and visualising it. Matlab has powerful functions / toolboxes to make this quite direct and I hope I'll be able to show you that you can achieve pretty amazing things with few lines of code -- as long as you know how to go about it (:smile:).

## Learning objectives

understand ...
- how *images* are represented in matlab
- how to display them, inspect different aspects
- the idea of *intensity* images, colormaps
- that there is a wealth of functionality available in the ``Image Processing Toolbox``
- that 3d images (volumetric data) is a natural extension of 2d images

## How are images represented?

You can think of images as a table of numbers.

```Matlab
A = [1,2,3,4;
     2,5,7,8;
     10,1,0,1]
```

For larger images (tables with many rows and columns), looking at printed numbers becomes unwieldy. So we can

## How to display images, inspect them
